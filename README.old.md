# tic-tac-toe app

Tic-Tac-Toe or noughts and crosses is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who make turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal or vertical row is the winner. 

# Application description

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is an online board game that supports competition between two human players.
First of all, players should introduce themselves. Both players enter their names in the form fields. After entering both names, the START button will forward the app to the Game screen.
Player 1 will pick the empty cell in the 3x3 grid and then the player 2 is on the move. During the game, cells will eventually be occupied.
The game is finished when all cells are occupied without a winner or when one of the players puts three of his signs in the same row, in the same column or on the same idagonal.
After the game is finished, the app shows who is the winner and then shows the history of the matches as well as the buttons for playing again or reseting the entire game.
